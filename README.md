# CLEANROBO
Circular Lifecycle E-Waste Neutralized into Robowax for Robotic Operations, Floor Cleaning, and Air Freshener
<h4>
This study focuses on improving robots by using Robowax, a special material that helps them move smoothly, clean floors better, and freshen the air. This makes robots work more efficiently, last longer, and require less maintenance. At the same time, it helps keep floors cleaner and improves indoor air quality. By using Robowax, this study promotes a more practical and eco-friendly way to support both robotics and cleaning industries.
